# HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - A Short Note

## Introduction to HTML

→HTML is the foundation of web development, used to structure content on web pages.
→Created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993, it stands for HyperText Markup Language. 

## Key Concepts:

→HTML documents consist of elements enclosed in tags.
→Elements are the building blocks of a webpage, e.g., <p>, <a>, <img>.
→Tags are used to define elements, e.g., <tagname>.

### Attributes

→Elements can have attributes that provide additional information.
→Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">.

### HTML Document Structure

→Every HTML document begins with <!DOCTYPE html>.
→The document is enclosed in <html> tags, containing two main sections: <head> and <body>.

### Head Section

→Contains metadata about the page (e.g., <title>, <meta>).
→Sets character encoding using <meta charset="UTF-8">.
→Links to external resources like stylesheets and scripts.

### Body Section

- Contains visible content like text, images, links, and more.
Common tags include <h1>, <p>, <a>, <img>, <ul>, <li>.
